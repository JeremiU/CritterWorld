# Critter World: Simulating Evolving Artificial Life

The goal of this project was to simulate and display a world of self-controlling artifical life forms (criters) capable of interacting with each other and the environment. 

The project was split into three sprints, each lasting only two weeks. The first two weeks were dedicated to creating an AST parser. This parser is the backbone of the critter system, as critters are uploaded to the simulation as text files that contain commands. Next, we had to build the actual simulation. We created classes that represented the world and its objects such as rocks. We also built a controller that progresses the world. Finally, we had to build a JavaFX GUI system to display the simulation and its changes as the world progressed.

Below is a screenshot of the simulation GUI. The silver hexagons are rocks, while the purple hexagons represent food. The rest of the colorful hexes are critters. Happy simulating!
